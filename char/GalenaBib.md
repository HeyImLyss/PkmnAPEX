# Galena (Synth Inc)

## Impressions (Come What May)

Galena's makeup makes it unclear as to how old she actually is, but the best guess is in her mid twenties. 

She seems more concerned about not losing rather than winning, suggesting that shes not in this challenge for its own sake, but to prevent something from happening later on.

Perhaps Galena has a sentimental reason for taking the challenge than one might expect. Though representing a cynical, hypercapitalist organization, Galena does so in service of her Carbink. 

Galena has always wanted to be a strong Pokemon trainer, but when she was very young, her mother got very sick. Galena had to halt her journey of collecting gym badges in order to take care of her mother. Soon Galena's entire life became helping her mother--feeding her, making sure she took her medication, etc. Carbink, the Pokemon owned by her mother before she passed, is all Galena has to remember her by; the only problem is that Carbink was never meant to battle as a Pokemon.

This faces Galena with a crossroads for her own heart's desire--desperately hold on to what she has left of her mother, even going as far as to use synthetic evolution to keep her mother's companian able to keep up with the competition, or accept that her and her mother's paths have diverged long before her mother even died, and pursue who she was always meant to be.
