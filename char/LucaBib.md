# Luca (Conditional Side)

## Impressions (Come What May)

Luca's age is undefined, but he's clearly of adult age. He seems stoic, almost cautious of doing or saying something that may contrast how he chooses to portray himself. An err of regret and pessimism follows him around. The theme of performativity radiates from his design, which could be turned on its head in his portrayal throughout the story. 

Let's say instead of him embodying aspects of performativity--of not being what how he portrays himself, seeking only validation from others--what if he's the opposite? Imagine if you will, young Luca as a member of Team Plasma, believing whole-hog in the professed ideals of the organization. Luca, young and full of passion, throws his life into the pursuit of what he sees as the unethical treatment of Pokemon as humanity's subservients.

Enter the ending stages of the story of B/W, and the dissolution of Team Plasma. Luca is dejected, humiliated even. Just a young man, working for years for an organization that stood against the same ideals he fought so hard for, vows to never throw his weight behind another's efforts again. He comes to the conclusion that he alone can pursue these ideals. Now, he refuses to be used for the purposes of anything but what he knows is justice.

Luca isn't under the impression he's going to change the world. He's not even convinced he can achieve his goals on any scale that could be significant, but for what little he can accomplish, he's determined to see it through.
