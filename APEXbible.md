# Apex World Bible

## What We Know

Our world takes place on an island, situated away from the regions we know. It might sit somewhere between multiple regions, explaining the great range of biodiversity among the species.

Several biomes make up the island mountain, from igneous caverns, crystal caves, radiant aquaducts, and a snowy peak.

We start on the island. Player character is one of the island natives--several fortuitous or unfortuitous events lead to the Player joining the gauntlet, instead of being just the bystander of years past.

Hub area 1, not far from the starting town, serves as our base camp for the challenge. This place is where the player gets the details of their journey, and understands how the different parts of the gauntlet are expected to play out. Any unfamiliar mechanics or idosyncrasies of the game could also be explained here by NPC dialogue.
