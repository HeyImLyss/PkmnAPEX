# Apex World Bible

## What We KNOW

Our world takes place on an island, situated away from the regions we know. It might sit somewhere between multiple regions, explaining the great range of biodiversity among the species.

Several biomes make up the island mountain, from igneous caverns, crystal caves, radiant aquaducts, and a snowy peak.

We start on the island. Player character is one of the island natives--several fortuitous or unfortuitous events lead to the Player joining the gauntlet, instead of being just the bystander of years past.

Hub area 1, not far from the starting town, serves as our base camp for the challenge. This place is where the player gets the details of their journey, and understands how the different parts of the gauntlet are expected to play out. Any unfamiliar mechanics or idosyncrasies of the game could also be explained here by NPC dialogue.

## What We NEED

We need to fully develop our Player character's motivation or explanation for taking on the journey as we have it. There currently isn't enough explanation to have the player invested in the protagonists story.

Better understanding of what the gauntlet means to different people in this world is required. Do most view it as a simple sporting event like a marathon? Do some view it as a spiritual, almost religious experience? Need further work on this (could also offer us opportunity to write some fun stuff).
